/**
 * "New crewmate" — the create dialog the Crewmates page opens from its header
 * "+" and its empty-state hero.
 *
 * A crewmate IS a crew record, so this posts to the same `POST /api/agents`
 * the crew manager's create form uses; the two stay one write path with two
 * front doors. The difference is what the user is asked first: a name, what
 * it is built from, and — in plain words — what it looks after. Everything
 * the crew manager's form also asks (workspace, model, routing triggers,
 * session colour) sits behind an "Advanced" disclosure, rendered by the SAME
 * `Field` frame and field components the editor mounts, so the two forms
 * cannot drift.
 *
 * "Built from" lists the installed kiro agents (the templates a crew can
 * boot), never the configured default CREW: a crew named `default` is an
 * alias, and storing its name as `kiro_agent` would make the new crewmate run
 * a fallback instead of that crew's template. The built-in `kirocrew` agent
 * leads the list and is labelled as the default.
 *
 * "What it looks after" is stored as the crew record's `description`: the
 * one free-text field the record already carries for a human-readable
 * account of the crew, and the line the crewmate's first greeting is seeded
 * from (see MembersPage). Memory is provisioned by the server on create
 * (a private store per crewmate, never a choice here), and the avatar is
 * edited on the detail page afterwards — the same split the editor's create
 * form has.
 *
 * Kept mounted and driven by `open` (Modal's own contract): `Modal` renders
 * nothing while closed, and the form state below is reset on every open so a
 * dismissed draft does not reappear.
