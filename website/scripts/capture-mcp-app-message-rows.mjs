/**
 * Screenshot harness for the MCP-App ui/message transcript rows.
 *
 * Runs the REAL built SPA (website/dist) with every /api/** call answered from
 * fixtures — no gateway, no agent: the inject-row renderer, the app-label
 * pill, the wrapper stripping and the queued twin render exactly as in
 * production.
 *
 * Two scenes, because the diff introduces two delivery states:
 *
 *  - DISPATCHED. The message arrived on an idle slot and became a turn: an
 *    `inject` row with `meta.injectKind: "mcp_app"` / `meta.appLabel`. The
 *    claim a picture must carry: the bubble shows the app's text CLEAN (no
 *    `[MCP app message from …]` machine envelope) under an app-labelled pill,
 *    the way a cron row shows its clock-labelled pill.
 *
 *  - QUEUED. The message arrived while a turn was live: the `queued` twin row
 *    rendered from the queue card.
 *
 * Every frame asserts the words that make it that state: the app label is in
 * frame, the envelope banner is NOT (dispatched scene), and the message text
 * itself is visible. A capture that only writes PNGs fails toward a false
 * pass, so absence of the banner is checked rather than described.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/capture-mcp-app-message-rows.mjs [outDir]
