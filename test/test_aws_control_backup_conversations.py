"""The kiro-cli terminal conversation export in ``run_sessions_backup``.

``data.sqlite3`` is BOTH the terminal's conversation store and its identity auth
store, so the sessions archive carries a TABLE-SCOPED export of it -- a fresh
database holding only the conversation allowlist -- never the file itself. These
tests pin the two acceptance properties that decide whether the fix is shippable:

* No byte of the auth half reaches the archive -- pinned by a fixture whose
  source DB carries a token-bearing table and a token column, asserting neither
  name nor value appears anywhere in the exported member.
* The archived conversation count matches the source row count -- pinned so a
  silently-empty or partial export fails loudly instead of shipping.

Both are mutation-verified in each test's docstring: break the guard, confirm the
named test reddens; the permissive path still passes.

Every fixture stays inside ``tmp_path``; the source DB is synthetic, so no real
kiro-cli store is touched and no ``data_home`` / network path is reached.
