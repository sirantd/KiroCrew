"""``api_session_tool_policy`` must not read the agent config on the gateway loop.

A managed MCP server (kirocrew-core, kirocrew-cron) calls this endpoint to filter
its tool list per agent, so it runs on ordinary request traffic. The handler
resolved the agent's config file inline::

    if not agent_path.is_file():        # stat
    config = json.loads(agent_path.read_text(...))   # read + parse

all three on the single event loop every other gateway request shares.

The proof below is thread identity at the real filesystem seam -- the pinned
``_read_spec_bytes`` open the strict spec reader reads the file through --
not an assertion that ``asyncio.to_thread`` was called. A spy on the offload
would keep passing if the call were later moved back inline behind some other
wrapper; the thread the read actually runs on cannot be faked.
