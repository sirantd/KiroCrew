"""``parent`` on the slots payload -- the edge the chat sidebar nests on.

The sidebar already receives the slots broadcast, so the creator edge rides a frame it
gets anyway. Two properties decide whether that works, and they pull in opposite
directions, which is why both are pinned here:

* the SHAPE is byte-identical to the Sessions table's ``parent``, so one moved
  ``nestsUnder`` serves both views;
* the KEY SPACE is this payload's own -- bare slot keys here, ``dashboard:`` session
  keys there -- because ``nestsUnder`` resolves ``parent.key`` against the keys of the
  payload it was handed, and a session key here would name no row at all.
