"""Every automatic persistent-memory writer is gated by the persistence switch.

``memory.persistence_enabled: false`` promises "no automatic memory writes".
The read side has a chokepoint (``_config_scoped_groups`` inside
``build_session_context``), but the write side cannot have one: the gate must
sit at the *service boundary* rather than in the storage layer, because
explicit dashboard edits and deletions have to keep working while the switch is
off — a store-layer refusal would take away the right to forget along with the
automatic capture.

The cost of that shape is drift: a future automatic writer can call
``write_lesson()`` / ``write_episodic()`` / ``write_preferences()`` directly and
persist while the operator's config says memory is off, silently breaking the
promise. This module is the ratchet that makes such a writer go red instead of
shipping: it walks the source for calls to the persistent-write primitives and
requires every enclosing function to be classified below. A new call site lands
in no bucket and fails, forcing an explicit decision about whether it needs the
gate.

It pins the INVENTORY, not the gate mechanism — that each gate actually refuses
is asserted in ``test_memory_context_toggles.py``.
