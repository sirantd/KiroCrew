"""``/stop`` clears the CALLER's queued messages, not the whole shared queue.

Under ``messaging.dm_scope = "unified"`` ``build_dm_session_key`` reduces a direct
chat's bucket to ``unified:{agent}``, dropping the channel and the user, so every
allow-listed person's DM on every transport resolves to one session key and therefore
one queue. Three layers have to agree for one person's Stop to leave everybody else's
messages alone, so each is pinned here:

* the QUEUE -- ``clear_queue`` with an ownership predicate keeps what it does not match,
  including entries another transport recorded and entries nobody claimed;
* the RECEIPT -- a bubble still carrying other people's lines is rewritten as queued
  rather than finalized to a cancellation they never asked for;
* the CALL SITES -- every ``/stop`` handler passes an owner, so a channel wired up
  later cannot inherit the whole-queue clear by leaving it out.

The enumeration is deliberate rather than a sample: the predicate has to answer for a
second sender, a second transport, an untagged producer, the same person in a different
place, and an owner it cannot name at all, and each of those is a different way to
discard somebody's message.
