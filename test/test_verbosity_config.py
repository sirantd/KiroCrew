"""Tests for Response Verbosity (``default`` / ``concise`` / ``ultra`` / ``answer_only``).

Lives under ``test/`` (the collected root per setup.cfg ``testpaths``) so these
run in CI. Covers four layers: the [RESPONSE PREFERENCES] block built from the
setting, its delivery in session context for every agent (and again after
compaction), the dashboard-config PUT/GET validation, and a guard that no
shipped prompt still carries the retired ``{{VERBOSITY_BLOCK}}`` token.
