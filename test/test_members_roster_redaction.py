"""``GET /api/members`` masks every agent-writable record string it ships.

The Crew Members roster builds each row from an explicit allowlist, and that
allowlist bounds the KEY set, not the values. The values are agent-writable: an
agent edits ``config.json`` directly, and the agent sync copies ``description``
off a discovered package spec, so a third party controls that string. A
credential-shaped string planted in one must not reach dashboard JSON.

``_roster_mask`` is the chokepoint: it replaces such a value WHOLESALE with
``_SENSITIVE_MASK`` whenever the redactors would alter it, and
``_roster_avatar`` masks the free-text ``traits`` and ``expressions`` leaves
inside the shape ``_safe_avatar`` validates. ``GET /api/agents`` routes its own
roster rows through the same two helpers, so these tests pin one shared rule
rather than a second one. They also pin the two fields that stay verbatim
(``name`` and ``slug``), so a later sweep cannot mask the row identity every
per-member route is keyed on.
