"""The macOS pool ceiling's verdict logic, EXECUTED as bash.

Split out of ``test_macos_platform_tests_gate.py`` and listed in
``test/windows-collect-ignore.txt`` because the whole module is POSIX-only BY
DESIGN, not incidentally: it runs the `decide` job's real bash against a stub
``gh`` whose executable bit has to survive, and on Windows ``shutil.which("bash")``
resolves the WSL launcher while ``chmod`` is a no-op on NTFS. Listing the module is
how this repository states a POSIX-only suite; a class-level ``skipif`` would leave
a marker that reads as a loosened ratchet while proving nothing on that shard
either.

Every property here lives in that script's control flow rather than in the
workflow's shape, so a yaml assertion would pass on a ceiling wired to the wrong
switch.
