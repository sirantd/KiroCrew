"""Tests for `{{WIDGET_BLOCK}}` placeholder resolution in context.py.

Before the widgets skill was introduced, `_resolve_prompt_templates` injected
~200 words of theme-variable rules + a `[WIDGETS]` per-message append that
duplicated the same content. Both have been replaced with a short pointer at
the system-prompt level and a bundled `widgets` skill the agent cats on
demand. These tests lock the new shape so we don't accidentally reintroduce
the bloat.
