"""The hand-off from a channel's busy path to the dashboard turn driving a resumed session.

``dashboard/channel_busy.py`` is what a Discord, Telegram or Teams dispatcher calls
when a message arrives for a resumed ``dashboard:`` session that is mid-turn. These
tests pin its three answers against a real ``DashboardState`` and slot: nothing to do
when no dashboard turn holds the session, a queue entry carrying channel provenance
and the admission containment when one does, and a refusal (nothing queued) when the
message carries attachments the dashboard queue cannot hold.
