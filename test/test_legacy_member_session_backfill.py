"""A member session written before ``execution_context`` existed is readable again.

0.7.0.5 wrote a member chat's binding as ``{agent, memory_store}``; 0.7.0.6 made
``execution_context`` the canonical carrier, and the start-of-process store
migration backfills the config and the V2 store but not the session record, so
without the read-time backfill ``read_session_execution`` refuses every such chat.

The read derives the carrier from the store's declared owner and persists it,
ONLY when the attribution is unambiguous: the store is a declared V2 store whose
``owner_member_id`` names exactly one configured member, that member is bound to
this store, and the record's own ``agent`` names that member. Every other shape
keeps refusing -- no member is ever guessed -- and the refusal names the remedy.
Records that already carry ``execution_context``, Global sessions and V1
named-store sessions are not touched.
