"""The session tree projection -- one test per promise that makes it safe, not fast.

Speed is the easy half and is not what these tests defend. The projection replaces a
scan with in-memory state, so the properties a second implementation would be free to
break are the ones that decide whether the state is ever WRONG: a read does no I/O at
all, the checkpoint is a shortcut that is discarded rather than trusted when it does not
match this build, the tail replay pays for the delta rather than the store, and the
emitter advances the fold only after the append that justifies it has succeeded.

The zero-I/O claims are asserted by COUNTING calls to the store's own readers rather
than by timing anything: a timing test would pass on a machine fast enough to hide a
scan, which is exactly the regression worth catching.
