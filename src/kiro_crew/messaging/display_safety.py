"""Redaction against what a chat platform will DISPLAY, not the bytes it is sent.

Every channel scans outbound text for credentials, but a scan of the literal
bytes is not enough on any platform that renders markup away: ``AKIA**REST**``
and ``[AKIA](https://x)REST`` match no credential pattern as written, yet the
reader sees an intact key once the delimiters are stripped at render time. The
transformation happens AFTER the scan, so the scan has to anticipate it.

This lives in ``messaging`` rather than in one channel package because the
hazard is not Slack-specific: Telegram (MarkdownV2) and Discord (Markdown)
collapse the same emphasis, code-span and link syntax. It was written for
Slack first and hoisted here when :func:`kiro_crew.messaging.renderer.
format_overflow` began putting LLM-authored choice text into the message BODY
on every widget-capable channel -- the shared sink cannot depend on each
renderer remembering to canonicalise, which is the same reasoning that put the
``max_buttons`` cap in shared code.

Stdlib-only leaf: it takes the redactor as a parameter rather than importing
``kiro_crew.security``, so it stays importable from anywhere and each caller
keeps its own (possibly session-scoped) redactor.

    """Would a reader shown *head* and then *tail* see a key neither half holds?

    A cap that cuts text into two messages is applied to the RAW string, while the
    reader sees the CANONICAL rendering of each piece. So a credential the model
    split with markup can be severed by the cut: each piece is scrubbed on its own
    and matches nothing, and the reader's client renders the markup away and
    rejoins the halves on screen.

    This answers the question directly rather than guessing which characters could
    hide such a split. Each side is put through the same redaction the sender will
    actually apply (:func:`redact_for_display`), then reduced to what the platform
    SHOWS (:func:`canonicalize_display`), and the result of putting the two sides
    together is scanned.

    Soundness, which is the whole point: ``redact_for_display`` already emits the
    canonical form whenever canonicalising reveals something the literal form hid,
    so ``redactor(canonicalize_display(redact_for_display(x)[0]))`` is a fixed
    point for any single string ``x``. Whatever this scan finds is therefore
    produced by putting the two sides together and by nothing else. No character
    class, no window and no
    anchor list: a search window built from a hand-written set of characters cannot
    be closed, because the next character the set does not know about is one more
    place a split can hide -- the walk that finds the window's edge stops there, the
    check runs on a span the credential's prefix was never inside, and it passes
    vacuously.

    BOTH readings a reader can produce are scanned, because neither one contains
    the other:

    * **canonicalise the join** models a COPY of both messages, and a client
      lenient about where one message ends. It is the wider reading for runs of
      delimiters, which concatenation can only extend: ``AKIA**`` beside
      ``**REST`` is a run only once the halves sit together.
    * **canonicalise each side, then join** models the screen -- two messages
      rendered separately, read one after the other. This is the wider reading
      wherever canonicalising DROPS text rather than just deleting delimiters,
      which is exactly what a link does to its target. A cut one character inside
      ``[l](https://x/AKIA`` + ``REST)`` completes the link only in the join,
      where the url then collapses to the label and the key vanishes from the
      scan -- while on screen each half is an unfinished link whose url stays
      visible, and the reader reads straight through it.

    So the join alone would pass a cut through a credential in a url, and the
    per-side reading alone would miss a credential split by markup at the
    boundary. Either reading finding something is enough to refuse the cut, and
    ``test_display_split_safety.py`` pins one shape per reading.
