"""Channel-neutral ``!temporary`` / ``!incognito`` session privacy modifiers.

Two modes, and what each one actually forbids:

Temporary (blank-slate)
    No memory reads, no memory writes, no persistence. The session starts with
    zero context and discards everything on close.
Incognito
    Memory reads are allowed but writes are blocked; the ephemeral conversation
    log is discarded on close.

Both are tracked in bounded LRUs keyed by **session key**, never by a platform
thread id. That is what lets one copy of the machinery serve a Slack thread ts,
a Telegram DM route and a Telegram forum Topic without any of them colliding —
and it is why :func:`is_restricted` answers correctly for a
``telegram:{agent}:direct:{user}`` key, which a ``startswith("slack:")`` test
never could. The LRUs are process-local; :func:`hydrate` rebuilds them from the
durable ``SessionMap`` flag so a mode survives a gateway restart.

What a second channel must supply
---------------------------------
Everything platform-shaped is a parameter, because this module may not import
``kiro_crew.slack`` or ``kiro_crew.dashboard`` — not even function-locally (the
one-way dependency invariant in ``docs/system-specs/modules/messaging.md``):

* ``source`` — the channel name, e.g. ``"slack"``. It is the audit label and
  nothing else: the SEL operation is ``f"{source}.{mode}_mode"`` and the event's
  ``source`` field is ``source`` verbatim.
* ``sessions`` — the ``SessionManager``. Supplying it makes the mode DURABLE, in
  two records for two readers: the per-conversation flag in the one
  :class:`~kiro_crew.session_map.SessionMap` instance it owns (so the durable
  flag cannot be clobbered by a second instance's save), which is what
  :func:`hydrate` restores the trackers from on every inbound message and which
  keeps the entry alive through ``SessionMap.prune``; and ``memory_mode`` in the
  session's own transcript header, the field every memory reader already
  honours (``is_incognito_transcript``), so a transcript read never depends on
  the map being loaded. Omit it and the mode is in-memory only, which is also
  what a test double passing no ``sessions`` gets. The header write goes through
  the default ``ConversationLog``: every production log reads the one configured
  sessions directory, so it reaches the same file the channel writes.
* ``notify`` — an awaitable that delivers one confirmation message on the
  channel. The text is :data:`NOTICE_TEMPORARY` / :data:`NOTICE_INCOGNITO`, held
  here so two channels cannot describe the same mode differently.
* ``on_applied`` — optional, awaited once per NEWLY applied mode for the
  bookkeeping a mode change implies on that channel. Slack registers the thread
  (``set_slack_link``) so follow-up messages pass its in-active-thread gate; a
  channel that routes off the conversation id has nothing to do here.

Two entry points, because the two shapes are genuinely different:

* :func:`strip_and_apply` — one text in, ``(stripped_text, only_modifier)`` out.
  This is what a channel whose inbound message is a single string calls.
* :func:`strip_token` + :func:`apply_mode` — the primitives. Slack drives these
  directly because it carries TWO texts (the LLM-facing message and the
  mention-stripped command text) and only the command text decides whether the
  message was nothing BUT a modifier.

Applying a mode is idempotent: a repeat ``!incognito`` in an already-incognito
session neither re-audits nor re-notifies, so a user cannot spam the channel by
repeating the token.

One path from a request to a published mode
--------------------------------------------
Every mode a caller asks for -- a modifier on a message (:func:`apply_mode`), a
reservation ahead of a steer (:func:`reserve`) -- is published by exactly one
function, :func:`_commit_mode`, in one order: the durable row is written and
its write AWAITED to disk first (:func:`_land`); only then is the session
marked, the audit written, the transcript header stamped, the hook run and the
user told. A write that fails publishes nothing and refuses the turn
(``persist_failed``): the user is told the message was NOT processed, never
that a mode is on which the next boot would not find. While the row is landing
the session is already HELD as restricted by every predicate here
(:func:`is_restricted` and its siblings read the pending registry beside the
trackers) -- fail-closed, not published: nothing is announced, and the hold
vanishes with the write if it fails. The mirror, :func:`_release_mode`, takes a
reservation back the same way: durable clear awaited first, then the header
restored to the strictest claim still standing and the mark dropped; a clear
that fails RETAINS the mode. ``test_messaging_privacy_mode`` pins the shape
structurally: ``set_flag`` and ``aflush`` are called nowhere but :func:`_land`,
and :func:`mark` nowhere but the primitive, :func:`hydrate` (which restores
from the durable map and skips a row still landing) and the two in-memory
wrappers a caller with no durable store uses.
