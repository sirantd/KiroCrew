# ``suppress_stdout_stderr``, which does a PROCESS-WIDE ``dup2(devnull, 1)``
# for the duration of the load (``_vendor/llama_cpp/_utils.py``). The first
# ``local_knowledge_search`` kicks that load on a background thread and returns
# a keyword-only result in milliseconds, so the JSON-RPC response for that very
# call races the load window. Written through fd 1, the bytes land in
# /dev/null: no exception, no short write, the SEL audit still records
# ``success`` -- and the client waits forever until the ACP tool-stall watchdog
# (``acp/client.py::_TOOL_STALL_TIMEOUT``, 600s) kills the turn.
#
# ``snapshot_stdout_fd()`` takes an ``os.dup(1)`` at server startup, BEFORE any
# tool can run. A dup'd descriptor keeps pointing at the original pipe no
# matter what a later ``dup2`` does to fd 1, so responses always reach the
# client. Guarded by a lock because it is a raw unbuffered fd: ``os.write`` is
# not atomic across interleaved callers, and a torn frame desyncs the stream
# for every subsequent message.
#
# NOTE: the suppressor also rebinds the ``sys.stdout`` OBJECT to a devnull
# file, so "has sys.stdout been swapped?" is NOT a usable liveness check -- it
# is false exactly inside the window we must survive. The snapshot is the only

    Three outcomes, and they are deliberately distinct because the caller owes each

    policy itself, one level down:

    * a session key — ask the gateway for that session's policy, and cache under it;
    * ``""`` — no identity on this install YET (a startup race) or an identity that
      was explicitly REFUSED (an invalid protected member record). That is the

    * ``None`` — resolution itself broke (an unreadable home, a raising probe). That
      is the ``resolution_failed`` class, kept distinguishable so a broken host is

    Source order. The first three sources and their order match
    :func:`kiro_crew.mcp_core._resolve_session_key_strict`, so the tool policy is
    never resolved from a WEAKER source than the tools it gates while a stronger one
    is present; the tail is the LENIENT one this lookup has always had (an unsigned

    the strict gate refuses would hide every tool from a session for its whole life —
    kiro-cli caches one ``tools/list``:

    1. The gateway's per-call identity is NOT consulted here: it is exact and stamped
       per CALL, so :func:`_resolve_tool_policy` uses it directly and never calls this.
    2. The protected member binding for this process. ``None`` means no private
       binding; an EMPTY string means a record that exists and is invalid, which is a
       refusal rather than an absence — it must never fall through to a token, the
       env var or a pid file, because each of those is writable by the same uid the
       binding exists to fence.
    3. The signed per-SESSION token on this process's own element. Above the env var
       because a warm-pool rekey makes the env stale, and per-session where every
       source below answers per PROCESS: one kiro-cli process hosts N ACP sessions,
       so the env var, the pid file and the ancestor walk all name the PARENT for a
       ``spawn_run`` subagent's server.
    4. ``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY``, then the ``KIROCREW_HOST_PID`` mapping, then the

    """Query the gateway for the current session's managedToolPolicy.exclude.

    ``caller_session`` is the verified per-call identity from the gateway's
    caller-meta extension (pooled topology); when non-empty it takes
    precedence over every source in :func:`_policy_session_key`, so
    sessions sharing one backend cannot inherit each other's policy. The
    RESOLVED session keys the cache either way — the policy returned and the policy
    stored are then the same session's, which is what stops a caller the gateway
    could not name from inheriting a co-tenant's or its own pre-rekey policy.

    ``caller_token`` is that same caller block's ``sessionToken`` -- the signed
    per-session token gatewayd hands a pooled control-plane backend PER FRAME,
    because the backend was spawned from the daemon's environment and has no
    token of its own there. It is passed explicitly rather than read from
    :func:`current_caller` because the ``tools/call`` dispatch evaluates the
    policy BEFORE it installs the caller ContextVar (the check runs on the read
    loop; ``set_current_caller`` runs in the worker), so at this point the
    ContextVar is still empty. The gateway accepts a declared ``X-Session-Key``
    only behind an attestation, and a loopback TCP request has none but this
    header; without it a pooled backend's every read is answered
    ``member_identity_unavailable`` and every tool call is refused. The
    ContextVar remains the fallback for a caller that reaches this resolver
    with the caller already installed.

    Returns the set of tool names to hide from this session, together with the
    reason the policy could not be read when it could not. Caches on success
    only, so a session that has ever resolved its policy is served from
    ``_excluded_tools_by_session`` and never reaches a failure path again
    (until FIFO eviction) -- the unresolved states below are reachable only for
    a session whose policy has never been read once.

    On failure this returns an EMPTY exclusion set with ``unresolved`` set, and
    the two consumers read that differently on purpose:

    - ``tools/list`` shows the unfiltered list. Hiding every tool here would be
      unrecoverable: kiro-cli calls ``tools/list`` once per session and caches
      the answer, so an empty list persists for the session's whole life. A
      listing is not an enforcement point.
    - ``tools/call`` REFUSES, loudly and attributably. This is the only place a
      withheld deny can actually be exercised, and refusing one call costs a
      retry rather than a session.

    An empty exclusion set therefore never stands alone as a permission: the
    audit event that records the failure is also what makes the fail-closed
    choice available without guessing which tools the operator meant to deny.

# Which unresolved reasons refuse a ``tools/call``.
#
# The test is not how bad the reason sounds. It is whether the reason means ONE
# thing, because a security decision derived from an ambiguous reason is wrong
# for half the callers it hits. Three reasons qualify, and each means "an operator
# exclusion may exist and this system could not read it":
#
# * ``policy_unreadable`` -- the gateway found a spec for this session and could
#   not determine its policy. It emits this for that condition and nothing else.
# * ``identity_unattested`` -- the gateway would not read the policy for THIS
#   caller because the declared session key arrived without the attestation
#   that goes with it (no ``X-Session-Token``, or one naming another key). The
#   spec was never consulted, so whatever it excludes is unknown here. Refusing
#   is the same withheld-deny argument as the line above; the reason is kept
#   separate so the refusal names the missing token, not the agents directory.
#   A legitimate pooled backend never lands here: it is handed the token per
#   frame in the caller block and ``_resolve_tool_policy`` sends it.
# * ``resolution_failed`` -- no usable answer reached this process: nothing came
#   back, the gateway answered ``5xx`` to say it is broken, or the resolve itself
#   raised. Every ``4xx`` returns before that arm, decided by status CLASS, so this
#   reason means the policy could not be READ and never that the gateway made a
#   decision about this caller. An operator exclusion may exist while the process
#   holding it cannot answer for it, so the exclusion set is unknown rather than
#   empty and the withheld deny stays withheld. The cost is bounded at both ends:
#   a session that resolves its policy once is served from
#   ``_excluded_tools_by_session`` and never reaches a failure path again, and for
#   one that has not, the refusal lasts at most ``_NEGATIVE_CACHE_TTL``.
#
# The remaining reasons stay permissive because each covers a caller for whom no
# operator exclusion is known to exist, or a class for which refusal is permanent
# rather than a window that closes:
#
# * ``agent_not_resolved`` is the gateway's 404, returned BOTH for a session
#   still registering (a policy may exist) and for a caller it can never map to
#   an agent (no policy can exist). Refusing denies the second class forever.
# * ``no_session_key`` is the same gap inside this process: no agent is named, so
#   no operator exclusion is known to exist for the call to bypass.
# * ``policy_forbidden`` is ANY 4xx. The gateway answered and made a decision
#   about this caller -- for 403 ``member_session_unverified`` that is the steady
#   state of a session claiming a private store without a verifiable proof.
#   Refusing would deny such a class permanently, and a boundary the gateway is
#   enforcing is not a boundary it failed to read. The test is the status class,
#   not a list of names, so an unfamiliar 4xx is permissive-and-audited rather
#   than silently reclassified as an outage.
#
# Those permissive windows are audited per call, so they are visible instead of
# silent -- which is what made this condition hard to find. Closing them needs
# the 404 to distinguish registering from unmappable, which is a change to the
# endpoint's contract rather than to this read.

    a threading.Event that cooperative tools (``wait``, ``spawn_sub_agents``)

    ``tools/call`` requests that arrive while a worker is busy are buffered in
    a bounded FIFO queue and dispatched in order as the worker frees
    (silently dropping them left the client waiting forever on a response
    that never came). Queue overflow gets an immediate busy error response.

    On Windows ``select.select`` cannot poll ``sys.stdin`` (it only accepts
