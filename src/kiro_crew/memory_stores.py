"""Named V1 stores and explicitly created member V2 stores.

V1 paths retain their existing layout: Global markdown in workspace/memory,
Global FTS in memory_index.db, and vectors in memory.db. Named V1 stores keep
those files under memory_stores/<store>.

A V2 member owns one memory.db with its immutable member/store identity and
all learned memory tables. Its manual preferences/projects documents remain
separate. FTS uses that same database. Only explicit new-member creation
allocates files; resolution never repairs, migrates, copies or initializes data.
The one repair is :func:`migrate_legacy_member_stores`, run at process start
and nowhere else: it gives a member store written before identities existed its
``member_id`` and ``member_database`` row, keeping every learned row in place.
Config membership and captured execution records route built-in operations;
these paths are not a confidentiality boundary against same-user code.

This module keeps only stdlib imports at module scope to avoid early security
and configuration import cycles.

    so the purge and the registration are one critical section on EVERY create
    path -- the dashboard, the CLI and an app's ``ensure_team`` alike, none can
    opt out. A purge that cannot be made (``crew_teams.TeamsUnavailable``)
    aborts the write and propagates.

    Updates may name only the fields the caller actually changed, preserving
    concurrent edits to other fields. None retains full-record publication;
    creation always publishes the full record. A new binding must be included.
