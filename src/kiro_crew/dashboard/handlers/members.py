"""Crew Members HTTP handlers — roster and per-member DM thread binding.

The Crew Members page talks to each crew member in one durable, pinned DM
thread. The thread's slot key is DERIVED (``member-<slug>``) and its binding
lives in the member's own space (``members/<slug>/dm.json``), so the mapping
survives restarts independently of the slot layer's own persistence.

Member slots are born ONLY here, with ``mode="member"``: the generic slot
create endpoint's ``_CREATABLE_MODES`` deliberately excludes it, and the
frontend's chat-ownership predicate (``isChatPageSurface``) does not admit it,
which is what keeps member threads out of the ordinary Sessions list with no
filtering code anywhere.

Dashboard-only surface: app tokens are denied outright (deny-by-default, same
posture as slot access — an app has no business enumerating the user's crews
or opening threads that speak as them).

    """GET /api/members/{slug}/briefing?member=<name> — a crewmate's own notes, read-only.

    Feeds the Crewmates page panel's Notes tab. The briefing
    (``members/<slug>/briefing.md``) is the crewmate's self-maintained standing
    notes — an AGENT-written file, curated by the crewmate for its future self.
    This endpoint reads and never writes, and the panel offers no editor for
    the file: the dashboard's file viewer reads through a redacting path and
    its Save writes the buffer back, so any in-dashboard edit of an
    agent-written file could replace a secret the crewmate wrote in the
    meantime with its placeholder. The notes are edited where the crewmate
    writes them, outside the dashboard.

    The text comes from :func:`members.read_member_briefing_bounded` and
    inherits its total contract: a missing or unreadable file reads as ``""``
    (the normal state of a fresh crewmate — never a 404), and content past
    ``MEMBER_BRIEFING_MAX_CHARS`` is cut at the cap with a visible marker
    (:func:`members.cap_member_briefing`, applied AFTER redaction so the cap
    cannot split a token past the patterns), which the panel renders as-is so
    the human sees the same overflow the crewmate is shown. ``supported`` is :func:`members.member_briefing_supported`:
    on platforms without ``O_NOFOLLOW`` and the pinned ancestor walk the read
    fails closed to ``""`` and the panel explains that from the flag rather
    than presenting an empty briefing as "no notes yet". ``updated_ts`` is the
    file's own mtime (epoch seconds) or ``null`` when there is no file.
    ``redacted`` and ``truncated`` each say the wire text shows less than the
    file holds (a secret replaced by its placeholder; a tail past the cap not
    shown), so the panel can say so above the notes instead of leaving
    placeholders and a marker unexplained. A successful read leaves a SEL row
    (``members.briefing.read`` / ``allowed``), as the rules read does.

    ``member`` (query, REQUIRED) is the exact crew name, same posture as the
    activity endpoint: slugification is lossy, and the exact name is echoed
    back so the frontend keys its cache by name rather than by a slug two
    crewmates can share -- and, as on the rules endpoint, the exact name must
    derive this slug, exist, and be the ONLY crew that derives it: the briefing
    is one file per slug, so for a colliding slug the notes belong to neither
    crewmate and the read is refused (409 ``briefing_slug_ambiguous``) rather
    than shown -- with an Edit -- as one of theirs.

    """POST /api/members/{slug}/perpetual — the owner's Perpetual mode switch.

    Body: ``{"member": <exact crew name>, "enabled": true|false}``.

    The switch drives the auto-nudge loop on the member's OWN DM thread. The
    slot key is derived server-side from the slug's binding, never taken from
    the body, so the route can only ever touch that one thread. Owner-only by
    construction (app tokens 404, non-owner dashboard subjects are refused by
    ``require_owner_dashboard_request``): arming a member from outside its own
    turn is exactly what ``autonudge_authz`` refuses everyone else, and the
    ``owner_arm`` admission it grants this route is recorded under its own
    ``armed_by`` in the arm record (``autonudge_selfarm``'s own masked leaf, which
    no sandboxed process can write).

    ON with no loop: arm a NEW loop with ``max_cycles=0`` and
    ``max_runtime_secs=0`` -- unlimited, which is the point of the mode and
    the owner's deliberate choice here. Finite loops armed anywhere else keep
    their own caps; nothing here converts them.
    ON with a stopped loop: resume THAT loop and lift its caps to unlimited,
    keeping its cycle accounting and its instruction.
    ON with an active loop: nothing to do; the current record is returned.
    OFF: deactivate the loop (``active=False``). The record stays, with its
    ``manual`` stop reason, so the drawer keeps saying why; the pending wake is
    cancelled by the service and no queued wake can revive it (the timer and
    ``notify_turn_complete`` both re-read ``active``). A turn already running
    is not interrupted. A structured monitor (``monitor_watch``) is not this
    switch's to convert: 409.

    trust write a task issues (owner record -- in the takeover and in the

    ``autonudge_selfarm.await_thread_to_completion``, so joining the task IS

    the rejoin, finishes the thread before the task ends. The join itself is
    bounded: a task still running when the second wait expires is given up on
    and logged, and its thread then finishes on its own. Phase two is a
    BOUNDED, BEST-EFFORT wait as well: the nudge service
    runs its own add/update persists as SHIELDED internal tasks it retains in
    ``_inflight_adds``; a takeover cancelled mid-update leaves one of those
    running, so the drain waits on that set for the same bound -- never
    cancelling them, they are the service's -- and logs at info how many were
    still writing when it gave up. Nothing takes them over after that:
    ``AutoNudgeService.stop`` cancels timers and does not join in-flight
    persists, so a write still running when the drain returns finishes on

    """OWNER TAKEOVER of a stopped member loop, as one transaction.

    Runs inside the supervised mutation task, under :func:`_perpetual_lock`
    for *slot_key*; the caller has established that *existing* is the slot's
    loop, inactive, and not a structured monitor. Because the task is
    shielded from the request, no step here is interrupted by a client going
    away; the sequence runs to its end and decides on what it saw.

    Steps: read the entry's current party with the STRICT reader (an
    unreadable or malformed record is indeterminate and refuses the takeover);
    rewrite the entry to ``owner`` stamped with THIS takeover's token (skipped
    when it already says owner: nothing changed, nothing to restore); resume
    the loop with its caps lifted and its cycle accounting kept; decide on the
    update's FINAL RESULT -- the loop the awaited service call returned, never
    the in-memory record, since the service rolls its fields back when the
    persist fails and only the returned value reflects what was written.

    Rollback: on a refused resume or a raised one (the service has rolled its
    own state back by then), the entry is put back to the prior party -- but
    only if it still carries this takeover's token, so a later takeover's
    entry is never overwritten by an earlier one's cleanup. A CANCELLATION of
    the task (gateway shutdown) has two shapes. Before the resume is issued --
    during the joined owner-entry write -- the outcome is certain (the loop is
    still stopped), so the entry is restored to its prior party, joined, and
    then the cancel propagates: an owner entry over a loop the UI shows OFF
    would be the whole admission for a forged ``active: true``. During the
    resume itself the outcome is unknown at the moment of the cancel -- the
    service shields its persist and may still commit -- so the resume is issued
    as its OWN task and the cancel WAITS for it to settle (re-shielded across
    repeat cancels), then reads the store: a loop that resumed keeps its owner
    entry (it is now a running owner arm); a loop that did not is put back to
    its prior party, token-keyed and joined, before the cancel propagates. An
    owner entry left over a loop that never resumed would otherwise be the
    same forge-usable state as the pre-resume case. One entry per loop, one
    party per entry: see ``record_owner_arm``.
