"""Session health from STRUCTURED state: task rows, slot state, ACP liveness.

A slot is *stalled* when the UI would show it as working but nothing is making
progress and no wait explains the silence. A regex over ``gateway.log`` cannot
decide that -- two error shapes and a 10-minute window cannot tell a turn parked
on a permission prompt from a wedged one -- so the verdict comes from the state
the runtime already keeps, in this order of authority:

1. **Task rows** (``taskq.TaskStore``): queued / retry-wait / waiting /
   recovering counts and ages, per row. A queued task is not stalled; it is
   waiting for capacity, and its age is queue wait, not execution.
2. **Slot state** (``DashboardState._slots``): whether a turn is running, a
   permission future is open, a question is pending, a ``wait`` tool is
   parked, a recovery retry is in flight, children are running for it.
3. **ACP handle liveness** (``AcpSessionHandle``): ``awaiting_permission``,
   the in-flight tool call and its dispatch time, the consumer park, and the
   notification ingress counter -- the progress evidence the in-band watchdog
   itself reads.

Each running slot is classified as exactly one of ``running``, ``queued``,
``waiting_children``, ``waiting_permission``, ``waiting_dependency``,
``waiting_input``, ``recovering`` or ``stalled``, with the evidence that
decided it and the age of that state. Only ``stalled`` is a defect signal; the
waits are legitimate and are shown as waits. A stall is called only after
:data:`STALL_AFTER_SECS` without ANY progress marker moving -- a bounded time,
so a truly wedged turn is flagged, while a long tool call that keeps streaming
(or whose liveness oracle vouches for it) is not.

The log scan survives as a SECONDARY diagnostic (:func:`scan_log_for_stalls`):
a matching line can add evidence to a slot the structured view already shows
as running, and it is the only source for a gateway whose state objects are
not reachable (a standalone probe). It never overrides a structured wait.

Effective caps and the degrade reason come from registered sources
(:meth:`SessionHealthMonitor.register_cap_source` /
:meth:`register_pressure_source`) so the adaptive controller publishes them
without this module importing it. Metrics are sampled on every computation
(``kirocrew.taskq.depth{state}``, ``oldest_wait_secs``,
``effective_cap{lane_kind}``, ``pressure_reason{reason}``); every attribute is
a closed-set value.

#: is NOT entitled (its manifest does not list that path) learns when to refresh
