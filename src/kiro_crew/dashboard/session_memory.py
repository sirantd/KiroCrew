"""Per-session and per-task memory accounting for the dashboard.

Answers "which session/task is using my RAM", the way a task manager does. The
measurement primitives already existed but were never surfaced:

* ``acp.runtime._get_rss_tree_mb`` sums a runtime's whole descendant tree. Summing
  only the runtime pid misses everything: that pid is the sandbox launcher parent
  (small, parked in ``waitpid``) while the kiro-cli that accumulates GBs is a
  child. It was called only to decide runtime recycling, and only for the shared
  ``_bg`` runtime — chat-session runtimes were never measured at all. This module
  hands it the descendant set it has already walked, so the tree is not walked a
  second time for the total.
* ``subagent.SubagentManager`` samples per-task RSS/CPU on its reaper sweep for
  learned sizing, and nothing read those numbers back out.

This module owns the ``/proc`` work (so ``SessionManager`` stays free of it, which
also keeps ``session.py`` from importing ``subagent.py`` — that edge already runs
the other way) and holds the two pieces of state a point-in-time sampler cannot
derive from one observation: the CPU jiffy baseline, and a short load history.

**RSS is an upper bound.** Summing per-process RSS counts shared pages (libc, the
Python runtime) once per process in the tree. PSS would attribute them
proportionally, but ``/proc/<pid>/smaps_rollup`` requires ``PTRACE_MODE_READ`` and
is denied for sandboxed children, so RSS is what is actually obtainable here.
Callers must present it as a ceiling, not an exact figure.

    (``state._attach_slot_parents``). Two implementations would let the two views nest
    the same gateway differently, which is the one thing a reader comparing them cannot
    recover from: neither view says which is right.

    The join is by SLOT, never by pid or title, and a row is reachable under
    every spelling its own writers use, because they do not agree on one. A
    crew log names a slot the way ``session_create`` attributed it -- the key the
    creating caller authenticated as -- while the row's key is whatever its own
    payload is keyed by: the full ``dashboard:`` session key on the Sessions
    table, the bare ``slot.key`` on the slots payload. A slot bound to a channel
    or cron conversation runs its turns under ``linked_session_key``, so its
    session key and its slot key are unrelated strings and only one of them is in
    any given payload.

    *spend_slot_by_session* is that correspondence -- session key to slot key,
    the alias :func:`_spend_for_session` already bridges for credits -- and it is
    read in BOTH directions here, which is what lets one call serve both
    payloads. A Sessions-table row keyed by session finds its slot spelling
    through the map; a slots row keyed by slot finds its session spelling through
    the same map inverted. Each caller therefore passes the SAME map and gets the
    same edges, where a one-directional read left a channel-born conductor
    nesting its workers on one surface and orphaning them on the other.

    *nodes* is the projection's fold, and each caller passes the one it reads: the
    memory payload takes :meth:`SessionMemorySampler._lineage` (whose companion flag
    is specifically ``over_cap``), and the slot payload takes
    ``projection().nodes()`` directly. The join itself needs no completeness flag, so
    it takes the nodes alone rather than a whole reading -- which is also what keeps it
    from deciding a question that belongs to its caller.

    An empty *nodes* means no row has a creator (the crew log is off, or nothing
    on disk cites one), and the storage package stays UNIMPORTED on that path:
    ``parent_payload`` is imported below the early return, so a flag-off boot

        A command line is matched through ``platform_compat.process_matches``,

        pathological ``/proc`` graph, which this walk is already immune to for a
        different reason -- it visits each pid at most once. Adopting the number
        here would therefore bound the FIGURE rather than the work, and a bounded
        figure is the worse of the two failures: a truncated count reaches the
        card as a plain integer no consumer can tell from a complete one, so the
        surface presents it as exact, while ``None`` is this payload's way of
        saying UNMEASURABLE. A count that is slow is recoverable; a count that is
        wrong and looks authoritative is not. Should the walk's cost ever need a
        bound, the bound that keeps that meaning intact is a work or time budget

        the pool the event loop also hands ``getaddrinfo`` and every other
        ``run_in_executor(None, ...)`` call. This sampling is browser-triggered on
        a 5s poll and spawns ``ps`` on platforms without ``/proc``, so parking it
        in the shared pool is what let a slow sample stall unrelated requests;
        task rows are read from samples the reaper already took, so they need no
        offload.
        ``get_slot`` resolves display titles (see :func:`session_title`); without
        it rows fall back to their raw keys.

        ``spend_slot_by_session`` maps a session key to the slot key its usage rows
        are filed under (``DashboardState.spend_slot_by_session``). It is only
        load-bearing for a slot bound to a channel or cron conversation, whose
        turns run under ``linked_session_key`` while its spend still carries the
        dashboard slot key — without it those rows report credits as unknown even
