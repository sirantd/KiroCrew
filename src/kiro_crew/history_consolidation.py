    A pass resolves its target's mode once, before the snapshot, then spends

    ``!incognito`` landing anywhere in that time must stop every write that has
    not happened yet -- wherever the next one sits: the next awaited batch, the
    next mutation inside a batch, the commit of a member transaction. A check
    placed at each site guards that site and no other; the four heads before
    this one each moved the same window one call further. So the check lives
    IN the write path instead: ``_consolidate`` and its helpers hold no store
    they write through directly. Every durable write is a verb of this gate,
    and every verb re-reads the mode at the moment of writing. Two tiers, by
    what they cost:

    * :meth:`admit` -- before EVERY mutation, on whatever thread performs it:
      the in-memory records only (:func:`restricted_in_memory` -- the live
      execution registry, a channel thread's trackers and map flag), dict
      lookups, no file read. Every write verb below calls it first; a member
      transaction calls it before each of its mutations and once more before
      its commit.
    * :meth:`boundary` -- before every awaited write batch or transaction is
      DISPATCHED (:meth:`run`, :meth:`run_in_thread`): the full resolution the
      pass started with, transcript header included
      (:func:`resolve_consolidation_target`), its file reads off the loop. Also
      asked once directly, ahead of the skill pass: that pass hands the FULL
      transcript to a model, and a transcript that just turned private must not
      be disclosed to it either, durable write or not.

    Either tier raises :class:`_ModeTightened`, which unwinds the batch or
    transaction in flight -- a member transaction rolls back, nothing partial
    commits -- up to ``_consolidate``, the one place it is caught: the pass
    ends with the same SEL denial and memo entry as a refusal before the
    snapshot (``_refuse_restricted``). A write that completed before the
    tightening stands; nothing purges, by the existing design line.

    The verbs below ARE the inventory of durable-write entry points
    consolidation uses, each named as the store names it, one admission in
    front. ``test/test_consolidation_write_gate.py`` reads that inventory from
    this class and asserts over the module's syntax tree that no verb is
    called or handed to an executor anywhere else, that every verb admits
    before it writes, that both dispatchers resolve before they dispatch, that
    the write batches are dispatched only through them, and that outside this
    class a store is only ever read. Stateless: a gate is (consolidator, key),

    ``crew`` comes from the session's ``agent`` metadata, which is the CREW alias

    alias and the store it binds to are separate facts. Each named member now owns a
    unique private store; recording the alias separately preserves its provenance.

    ``surface`` uses ``telemetry_channel_of``, whose output is a BOUNDED label and

        The skill is written through *gate* (``_process_auto_skills``,
        dispatched by ``gate.run_in_thread`` after the generation await): a
        thread whose mode tightened during the generation raises
        :class:`_ModeTightened` out of that dispatch and the caller's pass ends
        on it.

        Unlike history/semantic/lesson extraction — which correctly runs on the
        incremental unconsolidated tail — skill detection judges the last
        ``_SKILL_DETECTION_WINDOW`` messages of the WHOLE session, decoupled
        from the consolidation offset. A reusable procedure usually spans a
        session rather than the slice since the last consolidation, so a
        tail-only view systematically misses skills in any session consolidated
        more than once. The skill need only be demonstrated by PART of the
        window; the pass does not have to cover the whole session.

        Runs as its own LLM call so the consolidation prompt stays tail-scoped
        (widening THAT prompt would re-summarize already-consolidated messages
        into duplicate history/semantic entries). A per-session
        (rotation_generation, count) guard skips re-running when nothing new has
        been appended since the last pass, yet still forces a fresh pass after a
        transcript rotation (which swaps the window's content); genuine repeats
        are still caught by the dedupe verdict in ``_process_auto_skills``.

        The prompt gates on RECURRENCE, not effort. A session can be long,
        difficult, and rich in tool calls while still being one-off — a single
        bug's fix, a one-time audit of one component, a probe answering a
        question that is now answered — and the tool-call floor
        (``auto_min_tool_calls``) cannot tell those apart from a repeatable
        method. So the prompt makes the model name the future session and the
        DIFFERENT target that would reuse the procedure, and return null when
        the only honest answer reuses this session's own artifact. It also
        prefers null under uncertainty: an unreusable candidate is not free,
        because it spends the human's review attention on every later proposal.

        nothing and must not, or a broken host would abandon spans it never read.
        An exception (rather than a flag beside the result) is used so a caller
        cannot silently drop the distinction.

        Once ``stream_and_collect_json`` is entered the prompt counts as sent: a
