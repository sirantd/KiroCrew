"""Ship the local KiroCrew source to the instance via S3 (private-repo safe).

The public KiroCrew repo may be private, so the EC2 box can't ``git clone`` it
anonymously. Instead the launcher packages the *local* checkout into a source
tarball, uploads it to a launcher-managed S3 bucket, and the instance downloads
it with its own IAM role (no credentials on the box, no GitHub access needed).

All S3 work goes through the :mod:`cloud.aws` ``run_aws`` chokepoint. The bucket
is created once per account/region (``kirocrew-src-<account12>-<region>``) and
reused; each launch uploads to ``<tag>/kirocrew-src.tar.gz``.

    what decides whether the staging leaf inside it can be renamed away, and the
    home's ancestors decide the same for the home. Which directories are in scope is
    :func:`_chain_the_launcher_owns`.

    Two things make a directory unsafe, and its mode is only one of them.

    OWNERSHIP, first: a directory's owner can replace what is inside it whatever
    the mode says, so an ancestor owned by neither this process nor root is unsafe
    at ``0755`` exactly as much as at ``0777``. Root is trusted because a root that
    wanted to substitute the tarball does not need a directory to do it.

    Then the WRITE BITS, with the sticky exemption they carry. Under the sticky bit
    an entry may be renamed only by the entry's own owner, by the DIRECTORY's
    owner, or by root -- so sticky makes a directory safe only once its owner is
    already trusted, which is what the ownership test settles first. A sticky
    ancestor whose owner were foreign would hand that owner the same swap, which is
    why the two tests are ordered and not alternatives. Others-WRITABLE is the mode
    test rather than others-readable: the swap needs the write bit, and keeping the
    tarball unreadable is the leaf's own owner-only mode's job.

    Root-first, so the answer is the outermost problem rather than an inner symptom

    This is the follow-up that makes the instance permissions boundary a REAL
    ceiling against a leaked *launcher* credential (not just the on-box agent).
    The boundary is a SINGLE, content-fixed managed policy named
    ``kirocrew-ec2-boundary`` (see :mod:`cloud.iam`) — the launcher CODE creates
    it here rather than per-launch CloudFormation, so:

    * it is created ONCE and reused by every launch (idempotent — an existing
      one is left untouched, never re-versioned: that immutability is the whole
      point);
    * the generated launcher policy grants only ``iam:CreatePolicy`` +
      ``iam:GetPolicy`` + ``iam:GetPolicyVersion`` on this exact name (no
      ``CreatePolicyVersion`` / ``Delete*``), so a leaked launcher credential
      can't replace an existing boundary's content — ``CreatePolicy`` on the fixed
      name fails ``EntityAlreadyExists``.

    Idempotency + content verification: we ``get-policy`` first; if present we
    **fetch its default version and compare it to the expected content-fixed
    document** (``iam.boundary_policy_document(account)``) and FAIL CLOSED on any
    mismatch — an existing boundary is only reused if its content is exactly ours.
    This closes the first-write-race gap: a *permissive* boundary seeded at this
    name (by an attacker who won the create race, or a hand-created one) is
    detected and refused rather than silently reused to cap nothing. If absent we
    ``create-policy`` once from the fixed document; a concurrent-create
    ``EntityAlreadyExists`` race is re-verified the same way. All calls go through
    the :func:`aws.run_aws` chokepoint.

    Residual (see security model in ``docs/system-specs/modules/cloud.md``):
    the first ``create-policy``
    is still a first-write race for *availability* — an attacker could seed a
    boundary that then fails our content check, blocking launches (a DoS, not an
    escalation: a mismatched boundary is refused, and can never under-cap a role).
    Operators who want to eliminate even that pre-create the boundary as an admin
