    cannot admit them and a reclaim keyed on ownership alone leaves the ENTIRE
    accumulated backlog on disk -- the exact per-turn tool-spec cost this module
    exists to bound. Those aliases are still identifiable without a record: the
    name is Crew's own prefix plus the 24-hex digest :func:`prepare_native_skill_projection`
    derives, and a projected view always renames itself to that alias and carries
    no ``skill://`` resource (both are what the projection strips and rewrites).

    Deleting one cannot prove the pair unregenerable the way a recorded work
    directory can, so the safety argument is the caller's instead: every consumer
    re-prepares first -- the spawn argv, and ``session/set_mode``, which re-runs
    preparation before it sends the alias -- and the `/agent` command is refused
    rather than translated. A removal is therefore a cache eviction for a live
    pre-upgrade session, which republishes the same name WITH a record, and a
    reclaim for every dead work directory.

    Name and shape alone are NOT provenance, and an unlink is not undoable: an
    operator's own agent could in principle carry this name. So one POSITIVE mark
    the projection itself writes is also required -- Crew's managed
    ``kirocrew-core`` server entry, or the absolute steering resource pointing at
    THIS host's kiro home -- both of which the shipped builds that produced the
    backlog already write. An unrecorded view carrying neither is left alone; it
    is a smaller reclaim than the name shape would allow, and the right side to

    ``total``

    ``leased``

        residue as a side effect, which a census must not do -- so this is

        record counts here until the next spawn's probe reclaims it;
    ``foreign_home`` / ``foreign_leased``

        many an ownership sidecar attributes to a Kiro Crew data home other
        than this process's own -- spelled exactly as the publisher records it,

        neither bucket drains here and the leased one is not "held or
        crash-stale" from this gateway's point of view either;
    ``unreadable_leases``
        lease records the reclaim reads as uncertainty. While one exists
        :func:`_alias_has_external_lease` answers "live" for EVERY alias and
        nothing is reclaimed, so a diagnostic must not promise a drain;
    ``truncated``
        1 when a retention bound (:data:`_CENSUS_MAX_ALIASES`,
        :data:`_CENSUS_MAX_LEASES`) was hit, so the other counts are floors.
