"""The session tree as a PROJECTION: a fold that applies deltas and never rescans.

:mod:`kiro_crew.crew_log.session_tree` re-derives the whole tree from disk on every
read -- a directory listing plus roughly four syscalls per unit, for up to
:data:`~kiro_crew.crew_log.session_tree.TREE_UNIT_CAP` units, on a 5-second dashboard
poll inside a process with well over a hundred threads. The store is append-only, so
that work is almost entirely re-reading bytes that cannot have changed. This module is
the answer an append-only store deserves: state in memory, advanced by the writer at
commit time, read without touching the disk at all.

The shape is dsh's ``session-projection`` and ``session-projection-cache``
(``packages/session/session-projection*``), and the three rules taken from it are what
make this safe rather than merely fast:

* **A pure fold, driven eagerly at commit.** The projection does not subscribe to
  anything and does not poll. :func:`~kiro_crew.crew_log.emit` calls :meth:`apply`
  immediately after a ``session/opened`` append has SUCCEEDED -- durability first, then
  memory, dsh's write-chain order -- so the disk can never hold an edge the memory
  lacks. This gateway is the store's only writer (a pod or the internal gateway has its
  own data home), which is what makes an in-process projection complete rather than a
  guess about another writer.
* **The same reference while nothing changed.** :meth:`nodes` returns the SAME
  dictionary object until the state actually moves, so a reader that re-reads on a
  timer does zero work and a consumer can compare by identity. An :meth:`apply` that
  carries a record already held changes nothing and is not a change.
* **The checkpoint is a fold shortcut, never an authority.** It is "possibly stale but
  never wrong": every write is fail-soft (a lost one costs a longer tail replay), a
  ``ver`` mismatch DISCARDS the file instead of migrating it, and any doubt falls back
  to a cold rebuild. Nothing is ever served because a checkpoint said so and the fold
  could not confirm it.

What the tail replay is, and what it is not. On the first read in a process the
projection loads the checkpoint and then reconciles it against the store ONCE, at a
cost proportional to the DELTA rather than to the store: one ``iterdir`` for the root's
entry NAMES (no per-unit stat), heads read only for names the checkpoint does not
already hold, and records dropped for names that are gone. The new set is normally
EMPTY -- it is non-empty only when the process died between an append and the
checkpoint write, or when this build has never written one. That is the whole point:
the replay pays for the gap, not for the history.

:class:`~kiro_crew.crew_log.session_tree.SessionTree` is kept, unchanged, as the cold
rebuild path and for its own tests. Nothing calls it per read any more.

Two completeness flags travel here, not one, because two different questions are asked
of them. ``incomplete`` is the broad one -- a unit's bytes could not be read, or the
population ran past the cap -- and a reader that DECIDES on an edge needs it.
``over_cap`` is the narrow one, and the dashboard's ``lineage_over_cap`` means exactly
it: a page saying "this store is larger than the scan admits" must not also light up
for a transient read fault. Folding them into one value would make one of the two
answers wrong, so both are carried from whichever seed or replay last set them.

:data:`~kiro_crew.crew_log.session_tree.TREE_UNIT_CAP` bounds the records held, and it
bounds them on EVERY path that adds one -- the seed, the tail replay, and :meth:`apply`
alike. A bound that only the scan honoured would be no bound at all: the state is
long-lived where a scan's result was per-read, so an unbounded writer grows for as long
as the process runs. Past the cap :meth:`apply` admits the new record and evicts the
OLDEST held one by ``created_at`` (``sid`` breaking a tie, so the choice is
deterministic rather than dictionary-ordered), and sets both flags -- the state is then
genuinely missing edges, and ``over_cap`` is the specific reason. Age is the eviction
key because the record being applied was just committed, so evicting the oldest keeps
the sessions a sidebar is actually showing; liveness is deliberately NOT consulted, as
the emitter's commit path has no live-session roster to consult and acquiring one would
put a dashboard dependency on the store's writer.

        is the one slow step here and holding the lock across it would stall every
        reader for its duration. The cost of that choice is precisely this: an
        :meth:`apply` can commit while the scan runs.

        Such a record is strictly better evidence than the scan's copy of the same sid.
        It came from an append that COMPLETED; the scan may have listed the store
        before that append landed, so its absence there is a stale reading rather than
        a fact. The scan's records therefore go in first and the held ones overwrite
        them, which is why this merges instead of assigning.

        Replacing wholesale drops such a record outright, and nothing downstream
        recovers it: the emitter fires once per opening, so the edge is gone until the
        process restarts and re-seeds.

        A held record is better evidence that the session EXISTS, but it is not evidence
        that the session has no creator. A resume appends its own ``session/opened`` that
        need not repeat the creator, so a resume landing while the scan runs holds a
        PARENTLESS record for a sid the scan found parented -- and merging it over the
        scan would persist that child as a root, with no self-recovery once the state is
        checkpointed. The scanned ``parent_slot`` therefore survives a parentless held
        record, which is the same rule :meth:`apply` applies when the record is already
        held; the difference here is only that during a seed there is nothing held yet
        for ``apply`` to have preserved.

        Symmetrically, a unit REMOVED while the scan ran is excluded. The scan may have
        listed it before the deletion, and the state it was popped from was still empty,

        deliberately do not: they carry their own order, so the rule is the same one

        That is not a weaker rule but a stricter one. A takeover committed while the

        not hold gets its head read; a held record whose name is gone is dropped.

        The DECISIONS are reconciled on different terms, and they have to be. A head is
