# Security Deep Dive

The security **architecture**: what Kiro Crew defends against, where its trust
boundaries sit, and how the layers compose. Mechanism detail (exact rule tables,
regex shapes, per-function algorithms) lives in the module specs and is linked
from here rather than restated:

- [`../system-specs/modules/security.md`](../system-specs/modules/security.md)
  is the mechanism spec for every control below.
- [`../system-specs/modules/governance.md`](../system-specs/modules/governance.md)
  is the two-level Policy ∩ Profile model.
- [`../system-specs/modules/platform-context.md`](../system-specs/modules/platform-context.md)
  is the edition seam that lets a companion ADD (never remove) deny rules.
- [`resource-protection.md`](resource-protection.md) covers the DoS/resource
  ceilings (cgroup scope, RLIMIT, file descriptors).

Counts are deliberately absent from this document. Every posture count is
derived at runtime by `security_posture.py` and rendered in Settings → Security
from `GET /api/security/posture`; a number written into prose goes stale silently
while the code it describes keeps changing.

## Threat model

Kiro Crew runs an LLM agent with filesystem and shell access on the operator's own
machine. The dominant threat is **prompt injection from content the agent reads**
(web pages, repository files, Slack thread history, imported documents): text
that is data as far as the operator is concerned, but that the model may follow as
instructions. The two payloads that matter are credential exfiltration and
destructive local action.

Three properties shape every control:

1. **The model is untrusted input, not a trusted caller.** Anything the model
   chooses (a tool title, a file path, a command string) is attacker-controllable
   in the injection case. Controls therefore key on ground truth (the real
   `tool_input` command, the resolved filesystem path) and never on model-authored
   display text alone.
2. **The operator is trusted, the agent is not.** The operator may widen their
   own posture; the agent must not be able to widen it for them. That asymmetry is
   what the keystone (below) enforces.
3. **No single layer is assumed to hold.** A credential read has to defeat the OS
   sandbox, the path gate, the command gate, and output redaction; they fail in
   different ways and are not correlated.

The per-threat mitigation table (XPIA credential theft, WebSocket hijack, CSRF,
DNS rebinding, unauthenticated remote access, and the rest) is in
[`security.md` § Threat Model](../system-specs/modules/security.md).

## Trust boundaries

| Boundary | Trusted side | Untrusted side | Enforced by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gateway process ↔ agent subprocess | Kiro Crew gateway | `kiro-cli` + every tool/MCP descendant | OS sandbox (`sandbox.py`), env scrub, cgroup scope |
| Agent tool request ↔ execution | the PreToolUse gate's decision | the tool call as the model phrased it | `hooks.py:HookManager.on_tool_call` |
| Operator ceiling ↔ agent | keystone files under the data home | every agent read/write path | `security.is_sensitive_path` / `is_sensitive_write_path` |
| Agent output ↔ any human or external service | nothing | all agent-derived text | `redact_credentials` / `redact_exfiltration_urls` / `StreamRedactor` |
| Browser ↔ dashboard | authenticated session | any other origin or host | token auth, CSRF Origin check, Host allowlist |
| Slack workspace ↔ gateway | owner + allowlisted users | every other Slack sender | owner lock, `is_allowed_user`, Enterprise Grid check |

The single most important structural property: **the PreToolUse gate is
Kiro Crew's own gate, not the agent's.** Denied commands and the governance
ceiling are evaluated in `hooks.py` and are never written into a `kiro-cli` agent
JSON, so an agent config that omits or edits its own deny list cannot weaken the
ceiling.

## How the layers compose

```
Layer 5  Audit ........ SEL event log (HMAC-chained, verifiable)
Layer 4  Output ....... credential redaction + URL exfil scan + streaming redactor
Layer 3  Validation ... typed MCP tool schemas, unicode normalization, length caps
Layer 2  Command ...... denied-command rules + sensitive-bash + exfil shapes
Layer 1  Filesystem ... resolved-path gate (read block + wider write block)
Layer 0  OS sandbox ... namespace (Linux) / Seatbelt (macOS), default auto where supported

Across all layers: request auth (dashboard tokens, CSRF, Host allowlist),
                   Slack owner lock + workspace origin check,
                   governance ceiling (Policy ∩ Profile), SEL audit
```

Layers 1 through 4 are always on and are the reason Layer 0 can be optional.
Layers 1, 2 and the governance ceiling all evaluate at the same chokepoint
(`on_tool_call`), in a fixed order that matters: sensitive-path and deny checks
run **before** any auto-approve or trust fast-path, so a user trust decision or an
active YOLO grant can never route around a hard deny.

## Layer 0: OS-level sandbox (`sandbox.py`)

Confines the `kiro-cli` subprocess tree with platform-native isolation, hiding
credential directories by bind-mount (Linux user + mount namespaces) or file-read
denial (macOS Seatbelt), and scrubbing credential-bearing environment variables
on the way in. Windows has no Kiro Crew OS wrapper, so positively identified
official Kiro CLI spawns delegate to the CLI's built-in sandbox; their environment
is scrubbed by the parent before spawn. The parent gateway process is unaffected.

**`agent.sandbox` defaults to `"auto"`, engaging OS-level isolation
(namespace on Linux, sandbox-exec on macOS).** The only alternative value is
`"off"` (`config/loader.py`, `AgentConfig.sandbox`, `enum=["auto", "off"]`;
the same two-value enum gates the dashboard config editor in
`dashboard/handlers/core.py`). `"off"` skips Kiro Crew's own sandbox but still
delegates to `kiro-cli`'s internal agent sandbox on macOS when it is enabled,
which cannot nest inside Kiro Crew's
Seatbelt wrap (the macOS kernel returns EPERM even under an allow-all outer
profile), so exactly one layer can own isolation per spawn. Setting `"auto"`
re-enables Kiro Crew's own sandbox.

`wrap_argv`'s internal tier vocabulary is wider than the config enum: `standard`
(what `auto` resolves to), `cc`, `strict` and `off`. Those extra tiers are reached
by internal callers and by the governance `sandbox.min_level` ordinal floor
(`_ORDINAL_SCALES["sandbox"] = ("off", "standard", "cc", "strict")`), which clamps
a requested mode **up** before resolution, so an enterprise floor confines even a
`mode="off"` call. They are not values an operator writes into `agent.sandbox`.
Per-tier hidden paths, the empirical backend probes, the nested-passthrough rule
and the fail-closed/fail-open flags are specified in
[`security.md` § OS-Level Sandbox](../system-specs/modules/security.md).

Two properties are load-bearing at the architecture level:

- **Failure is refusal, not degradation.** With no sandbox backend available and
  a mode other than `off`, `wrap_argv` raises rather than spawning unconfined.
  Running unconfined is permitted by an explicit opt-in
  (`agent.sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec=true`) or, on a platform with no
  installable backend, by that platform's default;
  a separate flag (`agent.sandbox_allow_no_isolation`) only demotes the warning's
  log level and does not permit execution. The opt-in's default is
  **platform-dependent** — allow on Windows, where no user namespace, no
  `sandbox-exec` and nothing installable can ever satisfy the check, and
  fail-closed everywhere else, where a missing backend is broken or one AppArmor
  profile away from working and the guidance names that profile. The cost is
  stated rather than glossed: on Windows this removes a deny-by-default
  authorization. A declared `false` outranks the platform default in both
  directions, a governance `sandbox.min_level` floor outranks the declaration,
  and every unconfined spawn is SEL-audited `unconfined` naming the permitting
  party — the platform grant has no config file standing as its record.
  `kirocrew setup` still asks, in the direction that matches the default: the
  opt-IN where it is fail-closed, and the exposure stated plus the opt-OUT where
  it is allow, writing nothing on a decline so the host stays undeclared.
- **Windows Kiro delegation is not a global fail-open.** `is_kiro_cli=True` from a
  reviewed official-Kiro spawn site delegates directly to Kiro's built-in sandbox
  before backend probing. A Kiro-looking filename is insufficient on Windows.
  Third-party ACP backends, scripts, hooks and other subprocesses still take the
  normal no-backend refusal and require the explicit opt-in above.
- **Delegation is audited, never silent.** When `kiro-cli`'s internal sandbox owns
  isolation for a spawn, the decision is config-driven (never a reaction to a wrap
  failure), logged once per process, and SEL-audited on an audit-or-deny basis: if
  the audit cannot be written, the delegation is refused. Kiro Crew's own Seatbelt
  takes the spawn on macOS; Windows returns to its no-backend fail-closed policy.

**The crew-home masks do NOT apply on the delegated path, and that is a stated
residual rather than an oversight.** Kiro Crew's built-in HIDDEN leaves — the
credential homes, `.env`, `live_target.json`, `inbound-spool`, `whatsapp`,
`tasks`, `scratch` — are applied by Kiro Crew's OWN launcher (bind mounts on
Linux, Seatbelt on macOS). A delegated spawn returns before that launcher runs
(`wrap_argv` → `_delegate_to_kiro_internal_sandbox`), so inside a delegated child
a shell can open any of them. The residual is the same for every leaf and is not
specific to any one of them; only the caller-supplied `extra_hidden_dirs` /
`extra_visible_dirs` / `extra_writable_dirs` / `extra_expose_files` disable
delegation, because those are the restrictions a caller asked for explicitly and
the delegated sandbox cannot prove it enforces. Member memory does not add
another sandbox delegation restriction.

Extending the same test to the built-in leaves is the obvious remedy and it is the
WRONG one: on Windows every first-party kiro-cli spawn would fall to the
no-backend path, which is unconfined — strictly worse than a delegated sandbox
that happens not to mask the crew home. So the coherent fix is at the delegation
layer (teach the delegated sandbox the leaf set, or refuse the leaves' contents at
a boundary the delegated child still crosses), not at the mask list. Until then,
Layers 1, 2 and 4 are what cover these paths on those two platforms, and a NEW
leaf inherits exactly this residual: adding one strictly improves Linux and
non-delegated macOS, and changes nothing on the delegated paths.

**Launcher shims are deliberately not bypassed on the delegated path.** On that
path the shim is part of `kiro-cli`'s own sandbox mechanism, so resolving past it
would defeat the delegated layer. Where an edition needs a managed launcher
replaced with the executable it ultimately invokes, that goes through the
`PlatformContext.agent_executable` resolver, whose result is always placed
*inside* the same namespace/Seatbelt wrapper. The capability probe never runs an
edition-resolved or user-writable target; it runs a fixed trusted system binary.

### Why the default is defensible

The sandbox is the only optional layer, so the credential-read threat has to be
described honestly for the tier it runs at:

- A tool read of `~/.aws` or `~/.ssh` is refused by the resolved-path gate
  (Layer 1), which follows symlinks before deciding.
- A shell command is **not** path-matched (Layer 2). The command gate denies
  the environment-variable, SDK and exfiltration shapes (`env | grep AWS_`,
  `boto3 ... get_credentials()`, `curl -d @~/.aws/credentials`), but
  `is_sensitive_bash_command` deliberately matches no paths: a text matcher
  cannot hold against `python -c open(...)`, `awk`, a variable or a `cd`, and
  every spelling it did close denied ordinary commands whenever the fenced
  spelling appeared as data. The path regexes were removed for that reason
  (#9183), and the recovered command of a sandboxed shell is exempt from the
  path tier (#11223). The enforcement point for a shell's `open()` is the OS
  sandbox.
- The OS sandbox's **default `standard` tier leaves `~/.aws`, `~/.ssh` and
  `~/.kube` visible** (`sandbox._STANDARD_DIRS` omits them on purpose) so the
  `aws` CLI, boto3 `credential_process`, git-over-SSH and `kubectl` work inside
  the agent. So under the shipped default a shell read such as
  `cat ~/.aws/credentials` succeeds — a read-only command auto-approves, and no
  layer above the sandbox fences the path. `agent.sandbox="strict"` is the
  opt-in tier that masks those directories (Linux bind mount, macOS Seatbelt
  deny), at the cost of those same tools inside the agent; it does not tighten a
  spawn Kiro Crew does not wrap (Windows, or a macOS spawn delegated to
  kiro-cli's internal sandbox).
- Anything that still reaches tool output is caught by redaction (Layer 4) before
  it reaches a human or an external service — but that boundary is the human
  and the wire, not the model's context.

Changing the default tier is the wrong fix for that gap: it trades every
operator's credential tooling for the subset who want the fence, silently, on
upgrade. The tier is the operator's to tighten (`agent.sandbox="strict"`), and
this document names what the default leaves open so that choice is informed.

`SSH_AUTH_SOCK` is scrubbed whenever a Kiro Crew sandbox tier is active, so
ssh-agent forwarding is unavailable inside a confined spawn. Operators who depend
on passphrase-protected keys or hardware tokens use key files directly or leave
`agent.sandbox` at `off`.

## Layer 1: Filesystem gate (`security.py` + `hooks.py`)

`is_sensitive_path()` is the shared read+write block, and
`is_sensitive_write_path()` is its strict superset: it adds paths that stay
readable but must not be modified by an agent tool (the data home's `config.json`
/ `config.local.json`, which carry resource ceilings, and the data-home migration
marker, whose mere presence is a trust signal). Path matching checks the fully
symlink-resolved target as well as the lexically normalized and raw forms, so a
workspace symlink into a blocked directory is refused through the link.

`hooks.safe_read_file()` is the guarded read used by Kiro Crew's own non-tool file
access: it re-checks the resolved target and then opens the canonical path with
`O_NOFOLLOW`, which closes the TOCTOU window where the final component is swapped
for a symlink after the check.

The text, byte and prefix readers also check the opened descriptor before consuming
content. They require a regular file, a kernel-reported path matching the canonical
name validated before opening, and a non-sensitive target. An unavailable path
witness or an ancestor-directory swap refuses the read and closes the descriptor.
The name comparison does not resolve the original path again. Benign links already
resolved during validation and arbitrary authorized non-sensitive files remain
readable; this does not replace the separate hardlink and root restrictions of
the stricter `safe_read_file_bytes_nolink()` reader, which performs the same witness
check even without a root argument. The identity-allowlist reader retains its
opened-inode authorization. These readers, the media-copy reader, fixed-path
internal sensitive reads and export descriptor admission request nonblocking
POSIX opens so a FIFO cannot stall before the regular-file check. They do not
promise a content snapshot against an external writer modifying the same inode
in place.

### The keystone: the agent cannot read or rewrite its own ceiling

The governance trust root (`security_policy.json`, `profiles/`,
`admission_policy.json`), the denied-command opt-out state
(`denied_commands.json`), the SEL HMAC key and event log, the dashboard token
signing key, and the channel credential `.env` all sit on the read+write block.
This is a single mechanism with an outsized consequence: it is what makes the
enterprise ceiling **un-disableable from inside the agent**. An agent that could
read these could forge tokens or impersonate internal callers; one that could
write them could set `disable_all: true` and neuter the deny gate after a
restart. Every legitimate reader and writer opens these paths directly rather
than through the shared gate, so real functionality is unaffected.

Each leaf is registered under every known data-home prefix, so a not-yet-migrated
legacy home is fenced identically to the current `~/.kiro/crew`.

### Member memory routing and path guidance

Memory V2 assigns one stable member to one managed SQLite store. It separates
learning ownership rather than promising that same-host agents cannot read each
other's files. Member-specific OS views, hardlink scans, process ancestry proofs,
HMAC capabilities and duplicate protected grants are not part of this contract.
The host sandbox, credentials, HTTP/MCP authentication, owner/app permissions,
audit integrity and mandatory enterprise rules retain their independent duties.

Built-in file tools continue to guard `memory_stores/` against accidental raw
access and database/sidecar writes. Globbed project instructions skip managed
memory state. Ordinary Linux and macOS sandbox rules expose the named-store root
read-only: built-in writes run in the gateway, so sandboxed code needs no direct
write access. Linux prepares an absent root as an empty directory for its mount;
this creates no database or member configuration. Reads remain possible across
members. This is write integrity where the ordinary sandbox is active, not a
same-host confidentiality or universal integrity guarantee. Sandbox-off execution,
external host tools and pre-existing writable aliases remain outside that rule.
Existing named V1 root links remain supported; the Global V1 paths are unchanged.

Authenticated internal memory calls capture the session's canonical execution
record once and carry that binding into background work. An unknown member or
unavailable selected database never falls back to Global. Templates and projects
do not change ownership. Explicit cross-member delegation uses the target's
existing store and the normal delegation permissions. It does not copy learning.

The dashboard's explicit `?store=` parameter remains owner-only. The middleware's
user claim is distinct from internal transport authentication and from app-token
scope; a bound memory tool does not acquire owner privileges. Local owner-token
bootstrap still requires positive host provenance or a live backend launched by
this gateway. Its OS identity checks remain shared host authorization, independent
of which member stores exist. On Linux, a CLI peer in a different user or mount
namespace is refused unless it is a live application backend tracked by this
gateway. This intentional owner-token bootstrap restriction applies even with no
members;
cross-namespace CLI login from containers, Snap or Flatpak is not claimed as
verified.

Trusted storage APIs validate the selected database's member/store identity and
use SQLite transactions. The injection audit reads each member's SQLite lessons
and labels findings by store; V2 has no writable JSONL learning fallback. Global
V1 keeps its existing Markdown/JSONL behavior. See
[security](../system-specs/modules/security.md#member-memory-boundaries) and
[memory](../system-specs/modules/memory-skills-hooks.md) for the detailed contract.

### Audited internal carve-out

`safe_read_file_internal(read_id)` permits a small hardcoded allowlist of
system-internal reads of otherwise-sensitive paths. It re-verifies
`is_sensitive_path()` (a path that has stopped being sensitive means the
configuration drifted, so it refuses rather than silently widening), opens with
`O_NOFOLLOW` on a single descriptor, SEL-audits every outcome, and fails closed:
a `success` whose audit cannot be persisted returns `None`, because a log warning
is not an audit event and the carve-out's validity depends on every successful
read producing one. `read_id` is never constructed from untrusted input.

## Layer 2: Command gate (`security.py` + `hooks.py`)

Three independent checks run on every shell-bearing tool call, each against the
model's title **and** the raw command:

- **Denied-command rules** (`BUILTIN_DENIED_RULES`): first-class
  `DeniedCommandRule` records (stable `id`, regex `pattern`, `category`,
  human `description`) covering credential exfiltration, destructive
  infrastructure and data operations, publishing to a protected branch, and
  self-protection (the agent disabling Kiro Crew or minting its own dashboard
  token). Default-ON, user-configurable from Settings → Security; the governance
  `commands` scope is the enterprise force-pin that cannot be opted out of
  (tightest-wins).
- **Sensitive-bash detection** (`is_sensitive_bash_command`): refuses commands
  that reach the cloud metadata endpoint under any IP encoding or dump credential
  environment variables (`env | grep`, `printenv`, `declare -p` and their kin),
  after a size ceiling. It deliberately matches **no paths** in command text:
  the credential stores are the OS sandbox's to hide (the default `standard`
  tier leaves `~/.aws`/`~/.ssh`/`~/.kube` visible; `strict` masks them), and
  `is_sensitive_path()` fences every resolved path a file tool opens.
- **Exfiltration shapes** (`audit_bash_exfiltration`): data-egress and
  reverse-shell forms, narrowly scoped so it can be a hard deny at the gate
  without blocking benign local commands.

`SUSPICIOUS_BASH_PATTERNS` / `audit_bash_command()` are a **separate, advisory**
surface: they back the `kirocrew security audit` history scan and the posture
count, and are not enforced at the gate. The gate enforces the narrower checks
above. Conflating the two is the historical error here, so keep the distinction
explicit.

Rule-table contents, the two-pass whole-string/per-segment evaluation, the
verb-anchored git-publish detector, the protected-branch and force-push
semantics, the argv-structural self-protection floor, and the linear-time
ReDoS-safe matcher are all specified in
[`security.md` § Denied Commands](../system-specs/modules/security.md).

Every denial emits a `deny_event` SEL record; an exception grant emits
`deny_exception` fail-closed (if the audit cannot be written, the exception is not
granted).

## Layer 3: Input validation (`validation.py`)

Every Kiro Crew-owned MCP tool call is checked against a declarative
`FieldSpec` + `ToolSchema` before the handler sees it: NFC unicode normalization with hidden-character
stripping (control, format and surrogate code points, preserving `\n`/`\r`/`\t`
plus the four shaping marks in `_ALLOWED_FORMAT` when they sit next to non-ASCII
text; private-use code points are deliberately kept, because Nerd Font and
terminal-theme icon glyphs live there and are visible to a reader, so they cannot
hide a credential from one), enum allow-lists, regex patterns for identifiers,
range checks, unknown-field rejection, tiered length caps (`MAX_TOOL_NAME_LEN` 256,
`MAX_SHORT_STRING` 500, `MAX_MEDIUM_STRING` 5 000, `MAX_LONG_STRING` 50 000, and
the field-specific `MAX_CRON_MESSAGE` 50 000 for the cron `message` — a task
prompt, enforced on the MCP schemas, both REST cron endpoints, and the
`CronService` persistence chokepoint), and
response truncation at `MAX_RESPONSE_LEN` (100 000 chars) so unbounded tool output
cannot be a DoS vector.

The schema count is a runtime-derived posture value (`tool_schemas` in
`security_posture.py`), surfaced in Settings; it is not stated here.

## Layer 4: Output redaction

Redaction runs at **every** boundary where agent-derived output reaches a human or
an external service. The authoritative list is the `redaction_paths` control in
`security_posture.py`, whose registry is kept honest by an omission-detecting
test: every redactor call site in the package must be either a registered sink or
on an explicit non-egress allowlist, so a new egress path cannot be added without
someone deciding which bucket it belongs in.

The memory recovery, record editor, and member recall/copy APIs each register
their own output boundary. Their response fields pass through the shared
credential and exfiltration-URL chain before reaching the dashboard or MCP caller.

- `redact_credentials()` recognizes credential families in plaintext and
  base64-encoded form (it decodes base64-looking chunks and re-checks the decoded
  bytes), including cloud access keys and secrets, private-key headers, chat and
  forge tokens, package-registry tokens, and database connection URIs carrying
  embedded credentials. Key-value matching is JSON-aware and value classes are
  bounded at JSON structural delimiters, so a match in compact JSON cannot
  over-capture and mask the next credential.
- `redact_exfiltration_urls()` / `scan_exfiltration_urls()` are
  **domain-agnostic**: they flag the payload, not the destination. A credential in
  a URL is an unconditional floor; long query strings, base64 blobs and heavy
  URL-encoding are heuristics. A flagged URL is replaced with a redaction marker.
- `redact()` composes both in order for a single call site.
- `StreamRedactor` handles the case per-chunk redaction structurally cannot: a
  credential split across a streaming boundary, where neither fragment matches on
  its own. It withholds the trailing run of credential-class characters until a
  non-credential terminator arrives or the stream ends, emitting only the
  confirmed-safe prefix, with a bounded hold-back so latency and memory stay
  bounded on a pathologically long unbroken run.

Two ordering rules generalize beyond this layer and are worth stating once:
**screen after decode, not before** (screening an encoded form and then writing
the decoded value makes every escape a bypass), and **redact before truncate**
(truncating first can slice a credential so neither fragment matches).

## Layer 5: Audit (SEL)

The Security Event Log is append-only and HMAC-chained, so tampering is
detectable rather than merely discouraged; `GET /api/sel/verify` reports the
chain's integrity and `GET /api/sel/events` returns recent records. Every event
carries a `source` inferred from the session key (`sel._infer_source`, published
via `sel.audit_sources()`), and a call site may stamp a more specific source, so
the inferred set is a floor rather than a total.

The audit log is itself a user-facing, *durable* surface: string fields are
redacted before they are written or forwarded. A leak into the SEL persists in a
way a response body does not. See
[`../system-specs/modules/sel.md`](../system-specs/modules/sel.md).

Several security decisions are audit-or-deny rather than best-effort: a sandbox
delegation, a deny exception, and an internal sensitive read all refuse to
proceed when their audit cannot be written. The one documented exception is the
nested-sandbox passthrough, which has no safe alternative (the kernel denies a
re-wrap by design) and would otherwise couple every in-sandbox spawn to SEL
health; it logs loudly and proceeds, still confined by the outer boundary.

That exception has one carve-out, and only one: a **cron script child** whose
audit write fails with `ENOSYS`. That errno means the child inherited a seccomp
filter from a sandbox torn down underneath it, so it can neither audit nor
persist anything it goes on to do, and nobody is watching it -- its parent
records the run as ok either way. Such a child refuses instead of proceeding
(`sandbox.refuse_unaudited_on_dead_fs`, gated on a marker the cron launcher puts
in the child's environment AND on that errno). Everything else, including the
gateway's own spawns and any other audit failure, keeps the log-and-proceed
posture above. `test_sandbox_cron_child_audit.py` pins both halves.

The converse rule covers refusals, and it runs the other way: **a denial's audit
is best-effort**. Once a guard has refused -- a sensitive canonical target, a
project directory inside a protected tree -- the refusal already stands on its
own, so a failed SEL write must never be allowed to turn it into permission.
Denial sites therefore pass no `critical=True` and degrade to a WARNING naming
the operation, because for some surfaces the refusal is the process's first SEL
use and an unwritable log would otherwise abort the caller on exactly the hostile
path the guard exists to handle. `agent_discovery._audit_denied` is the pattern;
`test_agent_spec_hardened_reads.py` pins that every denial path in that module
keeps its never-raise promise under a broken SEL.

Best-effort does not excuse the row's absence when SEL is healthy, which is the
other half of the rule. Every refusal path emits one, and the caller names itself
through `operation`/`source` so the trail attributes the probe to the request
that made it rather than to the helper that caught it; a call-site ratchet
enumerates those labels so a new caller cannot land silently behind the callee's
defaults. A refusal that emits no audit call at all is the defect this rule
names. A refusal whose audit call failed is the rule working.

## Governance: the enterprise ceiling

Governance is a second, orthogonal axis to the layers above:
`effective = POLICY ∩ PROFILE`, tightest-wins. Level 1 POLICY is loaded at boot
from the trust-root path and is never merged from `config.json`; Level 2 PROFILE
is a per-surface, narrow-only ceiling. Both are enforced at Kiro Crew's own
PreToolUse gate, which is what lets a policy deny a tool or MCP call **even when
the `kiro-cli` agent config granted it**.

Architecturally the important properties are that the evaluator is
scope-name-agnostic (adding a scope is a `SCOPE_CATALOG` data change, never an
evaluator edit), that governance runs before the auto-approve path so it cannot be
bypassed by a trust decision, and that its trust-root files are on the keystone
floor so the agent cannot read or rewrite its own ceiling. Archetypes,
composition algebra, scope boundaries and the signed-policy authenticity model
are in [`../system-specs/modules/governance.md`](../system-specs/modules/governance.md).

**Computer use is deliberately not governed.** It is one operator opt-in on a
keystone file, with refusals enforced in band on the tool dispatch path rather
than at the fail-open PreToolUse gate. See
[`../system-specs/modules/computer-use.md`](../system-specs/modules/computer-use.md).

## Authentication and authorization

### Dashboard requests

HMAC-signed tokens with dual expiry: a short link-click window
(`LINK_WINDOW_SECS`, 5 minutes) and a longer cookie session TTL capped at
`MAX_SESSION_TTL_SECS` (20 hours), IP-pinned on first use. Every request requires
a valid token, with a small set of deliberate, secret-free exceptions: static
assets and same-origin vendored JS (the SPA and sandboxed-iframe bootstrap), the
local-bootstrap endpoints that authenticate with a loopback peer plus a
filesystem secret, the three liveness probes, and self-authenticating external
webhooks that validate their own signatures.

Supporting controls: per-session logout via a cookie nonce recorded in a revoked
set (so one session is revoked without affecting others); app tokens confined to
their manifest-declared API allowlist, deny-by-default even on internal paths; a
path-restricted refresh cookie so the app self-recovers after access-cookie
expiry; and the `Secure` cookie attribute when the gateway is behind TLS.

### CSRF and DNS rebinding are two different barriers

Origin/Referer validation covers state-changing methods. The `Host`-header
allowlist runs on **every** method, because GET-based exfiltration is the
DNS-rebinding payload, and it deliberately does **not** trust a loopback
`request.remote`: a rebound request *is* loopback at the socket while its `Host`
carries the attacker's domain. Both derive their allowlists from one source
(`check_origin` / `check_host` over `allowed_origins`, plus a canonical-loopback
floor from `build_allowed_hosts`) so the two layers cannot drift. Host validation
is deny-by-default (an empty `allowed_origins` denies, never fails open) and
rejects with 403 plus a SEL event. The sole exemption is the three liveness
probes, whose handlers compensate by stripping build-identity fields unless the
caller is direct-local, so a rebound request learns only the liveness bit.

### Slack

Deny-by-default owner lock: socket mode refuses to connect without an owner id,
and event handling rejects messages when it is missing. Trust and YOLO buttons
are DM-gated and suppressed in group channels, with a non-owner receiving an
ephemeral rejection.

Slack messages are processed **inline** and reach the agent directly, gated by
`is_allowed_user` and the workspace origin check. There is no challenge-and-
redirect interception; `send_channel_challenge()` does not exist and must not be
reintroduced on an upstream sync. The generic signed-token helpers remain and
back the explicit `/kirocrew dashboard` link command.

Enterprise Grid validation is a two-layer, **default-open** control: with no
`slack.allowed_enterprise_ids` configured, every reachable workspace is allowed.
`auth.test` caches the workspace `team_id` (plus the org-level enterprise id on
Grid) at startup, and each inbound event's `team` is compared against the cached
allowlist. A governance `channels.posture` policy is the agent-unweakenable
ceiling on top of the operator-editable config allowlist. A corrupt `config.json`
does not reopen the control: because `KiroCrewConfig.load()` degrades a torn
config to defaults rather than raising, the module positively detects that case (a
config file that exists but does not parse) and fails CLOSED, keeping the allowlist
enforced and admitting NO origin -- not even the just-validated workspace,
since which authenticated workspace is allowed is exactly what the unreadable
allowlist would have decided -- rather than reverting to default-open.

### Interactive trust escalation

Dashboard tool approvals offer four decisions, in widening scope: `trust_command`
(this exact command, session-scoped), `trust_base` (the base command glob, e.g.
`ls *`, plus the bare binary, session-scoped), `trust_reads` (read-only bash for
the slot), and `trust` (all tools for the slot). `yolo` is the global escalation.

The security-relevant property is what the pattern is derived from: the **actual
command in `tool_input`**, not the model-authored display title. Trust patterns
are per-slot fnmatch globs; a multi-command title yields one pattern per binary.
Trust never outranks a deny: the gate's deny and governance checks run before the
trust and auto-approve paths.

### Auto-approve (YOLO) has one duration

Auto-approve is time-bounded by a **single** duration shared by every ad-hoc
surface (`agent.yolo_duration`, default `6h`, hard ceiling 24 h, or
`until_shutdown` for an in-memory grant with no timed expiry that a restart
clears). There are deliberately no per-surface TTLs: giving the same grant a
different lifetime depending on which surface enabled it is unpredictable for the
operator without buying any security.

The duration is resolved from live config at activation time, so a value saved in
Settings applies to the next activation without a restart. A 5-minute grace
window after expiry allows renewal instead of a fresh activation.

The one non-expiring grant is `agent.dangerously_skip_permissions` in
operator-owned config: a standing instruction, deliberately config-file-only with
no dashboard toggle, re-established and re-audited on every startup. An
enterprise policy can deny it via the `yolo_duration` scope's `permanent` member,
which downgrades it to the ordinary ad-hoc duration.

Every lifecycle transition (`activate`, `renew`, `expired`, `deactivate`) is
SEL-audited. The transitions that create or extend auto-approval authority
(`activate`, `activate_scoped`, `renew`) audit **fail-closed**: the SEL event is
written before the grant is committed, and if the write fails the grant (or the
extension) is refused — auto-approval authority never exists without an audit
record. Fleet-visibility endpoints expose the live state
(`/api/status` reports `yolo_active` / `yolo_expires_at`;
`/api/admin/compliance/yolo-status` carries the full override status).

## Context isolation

Observe-mode channel history is gated on sender authorization: only owner or
allowlisted messages are recorded, so a non-owner cannot influence LLM context by
posting into shared channel traffic. Slack thread-root content, which any thread
participant can author, is injection-screened and dropped on match, and surviving
text is framed as explicitly untrusted data with a SEL event on every drop.

## Frontend

| Control | Implementation |
|---|---|
| HTML/SVG sanitization | Model-authored Markdown, highlighted code, Mermaid, SVG and icon markup pass through DOMPurify before a controlled HTML sink |
| Executable document isolation | Widgets and other executable `srcdoc` content use sandboxed iframes plus restrictive CSP rather than DOMPurify, which would strip their scripts |
| Safe DOM APIs | Ordinary text and error fallbacks use React text children or `createElement` + `textContent` |
| Mermaid | `securityLevel: 'strict'`, followed by sanitization, so an injected diagram cannot execute JS |
| No regex linkification | React elements via `.split()` |

## Credential file handling

`load_credentials()` tightens `~/.kiro/crew/.env` to owner-only mode at load time
and warns if it cannot (for example when the file is owned by another user). The
file is also on the keystone read+write block, so the agent cannot reach it
through any tool or shell form regardless of its filesystem mode: owner-only
permissions do not isolate another process running as the same uid, which is
exactly the agent's situation.

## Known gaps

Each gap below is a real residual, stated with why the obvious fix is not already
in place.

**No network egress control by default.** The sandbox hides credential files but
does not restrict outbound network access, so a compromised agent can post
non-credential data to an arbitrary host. Redaction blunts the credential case
and the `network.egress` governance scope can bound hosts where a policy is
configured, but there is no default-on egress boundary. A network namespace
(Linux) or host firewall rules with a trusted-destination allowlist would close
it.

**Regex and tokenizer command matching is not a shell parser.** The command gate
normalizes aggressively (quoting, empty-string concatenation, `$HOME`/tilde,
mid-word empty substitutions, local assignment inlining, literal interpreter
payloads) and adds argv-structural floors for the self-protection rules, which
closes the well-known evasion families. It is still not a bash AST: a payload
assembled at runtime (string concatenation, a base64 blob, an indirect `eval
"$CMD"`) contains nothing for a pattern to find. The un-disableable guarantee for
the signing credential is the keystone path floor, which these rules do not
replace.

**No audit dashboard.** SEL events are queryable over the API
(`/api/sel/events`, `/api/sel/verify`) but there is no UI to browse, filter or
alert on them, so tamper detection and anomaly spotting are manual.

**No in-agent sandbox-escape detection.** The gateway decides fail-closed whether
a backend exists before spawning, but nothing verifies from *inside* the agent
process that confinement actually took effect (for example by attempting to read
a canary that should be hidden). A confinement that loads but does not enforce
would not be noticed.

**Base64 credential detection has a floor.** Only base64 chunks at or above the
minimum length are decoded and re-checked, so a shorter encoded fragment, or one
split across messages, can pass. Cross-message correlation and entropy-based
detection would extend it.

**Write protection covers Kiro Crew's own trust root, not the user's shell
startup files.** Credential directories and the keystone are read+write blocked,
and `config.json` plus the migration marker are write-blocked, but ordinary
persistence targets such as `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` are not: they are not
credential stores, and blocking the whole home directory would make the agent
useless for its normal work. An agent write there is therefore a real persistence
vector, mitigated only by the approval gate and the destructive-command rules.

**Resource ceilings depend on the platform.** Linux uses cgroup v2 for
subtree process and memory ceilings when delegation is available. Windows ACP
agent trees instead use Job Object process-count and memory limits (with process,
not thread, semantics). macOS and Linux hosts without delegation have no hard
per-subtree process/memory ceiling; they retain the file-descriptor cap and
post-failure reapers. See [`resource-protection.md`](resource-protection.md).

**Launcher self-poisoning by the same user is accepted, not defended (CWE-345;
tracked as CWE-778 by
[#371](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/pull/371) /
[#417](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/issues/417)).** The resolved
`kiro-cli` launcher is executed in place with no signature, hash, ownership or
install-source check — the only gate is `platform_compat.is_executable_file`
(`kiro_cli.py`) — so an agent running as the invoking user can overwrite its own
launcher and have those bytes executed on the next spawn. **Status: ACCEPTED.**
The mechanism that would close it is *rejected by design*, not missing by
oversight: see
[`security.md` § Kiro prerequisite setup boundary](../system-specs/modules/security.md),
which records that trust is "the CLI runs, and it has a valid login" regardless
of install source, owner, or fixed path, because Kiro Crew is not the authority
on where Kiro CLI lives and its own self-updater legitimately rewrites those
bytes as the user — an owner / path / Developer-ID gate would strand real
installs (toolbox, Homebrew, winget, a self-updated `/Applications` bundle) with
no in-product recovery path. The same section records the sibling resolve-to-exec
byte-binding copy as deliberately removed ("Do NOT reintroduce it") once Kiro CLI
became a multi-call binary. The accepted tradeoff is therefore **install-model
compatibility over a same-UID integrity check**: the attack presupposes local
write access as the operator, which is outside this product's threat model (an
attacker holding the operator's UID already owns the account) and is not
defended against anywhere else — `~/.bashrc`, above, is the same class. Residual
blast radius is bounded on the confined spawn paths (Linux namespace, macOS
seatbelt) which run even a poisoned launcher inside Kiro Crew's own sandbox;
only macOS internal-sandbox delegation exec's it directly. A multi-tenant or
enterprise posture would need signing infrastructure, key management and an
install-layout decision, and any such gate must default **off** — the
`KIROCREW_PROVIDER_BIN_STRICT` precedent
(`github_runner.py:validate_provider_executable`) records that requiring a
root-owned copy made every stock package-manager install fail.
